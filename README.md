# SteamBot
This program is a simple steambot for Valve's Steam. The bot is limited to steamkit2 functionality. Chat can easily be implemented. Accepts all friend requests.

Things to implement:
-http functionality to manage trading.
-chat commands (not sure if I care to add this)(maybe after trading it will be useful)
